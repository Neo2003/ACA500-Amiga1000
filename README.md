# ACA500-Amiga1000
This repository contains the 3D parts to create a box for ACA500+ card that matches the Amiga 1000 design.

You will find STL files but also source files written with OpenSCAD.

All was done in French, so here is a small translation:
- Boite: box
- Avant: front
- Basse: bottom
- Sup. short for sup√©rieur: top
- Pied: foot
